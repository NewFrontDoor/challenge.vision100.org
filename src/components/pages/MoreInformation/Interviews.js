                                                    <p>One of the unique aspects of Challenge is that if this is your first or second time at the conference, we will arrange an ‘interview’ for you with a Christian experienced in ministry.</p>

                                                    <p>These interviews are a very relaxed and informal opportunity for you to think through how you're going in your own ministry at church. It provides you with the chance to think about the future and how you can grow in your service to God.</p>

                                                    <p>While we think that the interview is an integral part of the conference we don't want you to feel like you must have one. If you do not want one please let us know by the 31 st of July by emailing jess@vision100.org.</p>

                                                    <p>If you have been to Challenge Conference more than twice, you will not automatically be signed up for an interview. If you would like one, please email using the above email.</p>
